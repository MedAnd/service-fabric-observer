**INTRODUCTION**

FabricObserver (FO) is a complete, working example of a fully functioning, easily-configurable stateless Service Fabric (SF) service that monitors both user services and internal fabric services for potential problems related to resource usage across Disk, CPU, Memory, Networking. It employs a simple .NET development model, enabling the quick creation of new observers (implement a few functions from an abstract base class...). You can deploy the sfpkg directly from Releases and get benefits from this service without doing anything. However, you will definitely want to take advantage of configuration to better support your specific workloads and app deployments. The point is that you can use FabricObserver immediately without doing anything but deploying it. As Service Fabric developers, you can extend FabricObserver very easily and make it work specifically for your needs. These aren't just watchdogs. They are observers.

FO is implemented using Service Fabricâ€™s public API surface only. It does not ship with SF. It is independent of the SF runtime engineering schedule.

FO is composed of Observer objects (instance types) that are designed to observe, record, and report on several machine-level environmental conditions inside a Windows VM (node) of a Service Fabric cluster. An observer, by design, does not communicate over the Internet. In fact, FabricObserver does not listen on any ports. It is an isolated, node-only, service.

In Warning and Error states, an observer will signal status (reports) via a Service Fabric Health Report (e.g., extended, high CPU and Memory usage, extended Disk IO, limited Disk space, Networking issues (latency, unavailability, unusually high or low network IO). Since an observer doesn't know what's good or what's bad by simply observing some resource state (in some cases, like disk space monitoring and fabric system service monitoring, there are predefined maxima/minima), a user must provide Warning and Error thresholds that ring the alarm bells. These settings are supplied and packaged in Service Fabric configuration files (both XML and JSON are supported).

<!--- What is meant by optionally logs to long-running resource usage data? -->
Finally, FO logs to disk, optionally logs to long-running resource usage data in CSV files, and signals SF Health Reports under Warning and Error conditions. It ships with an AppInsights telemetry implementation and you can use whatever provider you want. All of these are configurable across feature enablement and verbosity (in the case of file logging).

<!--- Do not think this is necessary: This should be relatively easy to do, but we are focusing on Windows in the first release as most of our customers run Service Fabric on Windows VMs... -->
Currently, FabricObserver is implemented as a full framework .NET Desktop Application, which means it is Windows-only. There is a ToDo to convert to .NET Core 2.2.x.

In this iteration of the project, we have designed Observers that can be configured by users to monitor the machine-level side effects of an App (defined as a collection of Service Fabric services). The user-controlled,
App-focused functionality is primarily encapsulated in  **AppObserver**, which observes, records and reports on real-time CPU, Memory, Disk, active and ephemeral TCP port counts as defined by the user in a Data
configuration file (JSON, App array objects). Likewise, there is the configurable, App-focused **NetworkObserver**.

<!--- You can learn a lot more about the set of existing observers further down this relatively long readme...\ -->
\
For the most part, **we focus on both the state of the system surrounding a Service Fabric app and the specific side effects of 
the app's (mis)behavior**. Most observers focus on machine level states: 
Disk (local storage disk health/availability, space usage, IO), CPU (per
process across Apps and Fabric system services), Memory (per process
across Apps and Fabric system services as well as system-wide), Networking (general health and
monitoring of availability of user-specified, per-app endpoints), basic OS
properties (install date, health status, list of hot fixes, hardware configuration,
etc., ephemeral port range and real-time status), and Service Fabric infrastructure information and state. The design is decidedly simplistic and easy to understand/implement. C# and .NET make this very easy to do. Since the product is OSS, anybody can author scenario-specific observers themselves very quickly (or extend currently implemented ones) to meet
their monitoring and reporting needs. The idea is that an Observer observes user-specified conditions, reports, and logs/streams. Observers do not mitigate. 

***GOAL***

**The uber goal here is to greatly reduce the complexity of host OS, Service Fabric infrastructure, and Service Fabric app health monitoring**. For SF app developers, it's as easy as supplying some simple configuration files (JSON and XML).
Empower cloud developers to understand and learn from inevitable failure conditions by not adding more cognitive complexity to their lives - reliably ***enabling self-mitigation before problems turn into incidents***.

***SCOPE***

<!--- Many external customers will not be aware of what an ICM is -->
As stated, the goal of this project, is to help enable Service Fabric customers to self-mitigate issues. With knowledge comes power. For this initial release, the scope is improving a developer's knowledge about the actual health state of the environment in which their services are running. As we move to the next phase we will include Policy-driven Action that is owned by the user (not by SF). This will reside in a FabricHealer service.

***DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS***

**Observer** -- conceptually equivalent to "Watchdog", however, we want
to make it even more explicit that the nature of these objects is
non-reactive, meaning they do not mitigate, they observe, record, and
report. Plus, Observer is a much cooler name than Watchdog ;-)


***Design***

**Conclusion**

Observers are designed to be low impact, long-lived objects that perform
specific observational and related reporting activities across iteration 
intervals defined in configuration settings for each observer type. 
As their name clearly suggests, they do not mitigate in this first version. 
They observe, record, and report. For Warning and Errors, we will utilize Service Fabric Health store and reporting mechanisms to surface important information in SFX. This release also includes a telemtry provider interface and
ships with an AppInsights implementation. So, you can stream events to AppInsights in addition
to file logging and SFX health reporting. We also have an internal telemetry provider that will stream FO-related telemetry to Microsoft, so that we can understand how FO is doing in the real world. This facility does not send PII data or anything related to 
your apps, settings, etc... The only data that we receive is basic information about the SF cluster and FO state. Just look at that the implementation in Utilities/Telemetry folder. You can turn this off, of course, but we would appreciate it if you didn't. We want to know how FO is doing and we need data to understand what's working and what isn't (again, FO-only data, nothing about your code, your data, your information - you can see exactly what we are sending since you have the code). We hope you find FabricObserver useful and that it never adds any burden to your cluster - it should be a silent partner up until it let's you know something is wrong based on what you asked FO to observe and report. Please put FO into all of your Service Fabric deployments and help yourself catch issues before they become incidents. Also, we'd love your contributions and partnership. 

Just observe it.

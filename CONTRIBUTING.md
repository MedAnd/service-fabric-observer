## Contributing code and content
We welcome all forms of contributions from the community. Please read the following guidelines to maximize the chances of your PR being merged.

### Reporting security issues and bugs
Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)  secure@microsoft.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094.aspx).


### Development process
Please be sure to follow the usual process for submitting PRs:

 - Fork the repo
 - Create an Issue describing your intended contribution.
 - Run - and pass - all FabricObserverTests unit tests on your dev machine with a running SF dev cluster *before* you make a PR.
 - Make sure your PR title is descriptive.
 - Include a link back to an open issue in the PR description.

We reserve the right to close PRs that are not making progress. If no changes are made for 21 days, we'll close the PR. Closed PRs can be reopened again later and work can resume.

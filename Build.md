***Build Notes***

After cloning, the .NET Core 2.2 SDK will need to be manually installed in order for FabricObserverWeb to be built - [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2). FabricObserverWeb is the stateless ASP.NET Core REST API service (node-local) used to query FabricObserver for Error and Warning states.

*Note: Different versions of Visual Studio necessitate different versions of the SDK to be installed - make sure the correct version is installed.*
